# Architecture Laws

- Material → Component → Behavior layering.
- Component expresses intent; owner executes.
- Component host is never draggable.
- Component cannot delete itself.
- Shadow DOM boundaries must be respected.
- Owner listens at highest stable boundary.
- Communication must not depend on internal DOM structure.
