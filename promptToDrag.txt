When I create a card using the handleCreateCardClick, I want that the card be dragleable. For this 
I want use a shell element strategy
We can drag the element clicking at any part of the element
While dragging, the collum listens to dragover on the container.
The container always calls preventDefault() so dropping is allowed.
If there is no active dragged shell (_draggingShell is null), nothing happens.
Otherwise:

The Collums ensures a placeholder element exists (created once, reused).
It calculates which shell is currently “after” the pointer (based on X position).
It inserts the placeholder in the correct position:
at the end, if no “after element” exists
or before the “after element”, if it exists

Drag start behavior (when dragging begins)
Dragging is handled at the container level using event delegation.
A drag operation is only allowed if the dragstart originates from:

an element that is (or is inside) ui-card-retro.

If dragstart did not come from the move icon:

drag is cancelled (preventDefault()).

If dragstart is valid:

the collum identifies the corresponding shell 

that shell becomes the active dragged item (this._draggingShell = shell).

the shell receives a “dragging” CSS state class
the drag payload is “enabled” for moving:
effectAllowed = "move"
empty data is set to satisfy some browsers.

While dragging, the gallery listens to dragover on the container.
The container always calls preventDefault() so dropping is allowed.
If there is no active dragged shell (_draggingShell is null), nothing happens.
Otherwise:
The gallery ensures a placeholder element exists (created once, reused).
It calculates which shell is currently “after” the pointer (based on X position).
It inserts the placeholder in the correct position:
at the end, if no “after element” exists
or before the “after element”, if it exists

Drop behavior (when the user releases)

On drop:

Default is prevented.
If no active dragged shell exists, nothing happens.
If placeholder exists inside the container:
The dragged shell is inserted before the placeholder
Placeholder is removed
Dragging state is cleared:
remove CSS class
_draggingShell = null

Drag end behavior (cleanup)
When dragging ends (successful or canceled):
the dragging class is removed (if any)
_draggingShell is cleared
placeholder is removed if it exists
